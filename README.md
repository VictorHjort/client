JEOPARTY - Client
_________________________________

Game description:

Jeoparty is a game based on the famous quiz-game jeopardy in which players compete for points
by asking the right question to the answers presented.

The players each take turns answering a question.

Points are calculated from the associated question being either added or deducted based 
on whether it was answered correctly.

When no more questions are left the player with the most points will be declared winner.

How to run the game: 

Unszip the files from the folder collectively to where you please. 
Run the "executable file". 
For further development, the graphic components of the project is made with JavaFX.

How to join a game:

Firstly the console on the server will display the ip address and port. Share these with your friends. 
The client asks you to fill out the IP address and port. 
You client will then switch to a lobby and the first player who joins becomes the host of the game. 
When all 3 players are connected the game can begin.

DISCLAMER: On the question board page, only the five buttons under the first category work. One question per game.
